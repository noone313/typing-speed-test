### How the Program Works:
The program executes a typing speed test using a text-based interface in the terminal. Upon running the program, a random text for the test appears on the screen, and the user is required to type the displayed text quickly using the keyboard. The inputs are tracked, and the number of correct and incorrect characters is continuously displayed while typing.

### Benefits of the Program:
1. **Improving Typing Speed**: The program helps improve typing speed by providing continuous practice with typing various texts.
2. **Enhancing Accuracy**: In addition to increasing speed, the program helps improve typing accuracy by instantly tracking and displaying errors.
3. **Developing Touch Typing Skills**: The program relies on keyboard input without looking at the hands, which helps in developing touch typing skills.
4. **Fun and Challenge**: The program offers an interactive and enjoyable experience for users, along with a new challenge to overcome and achieve continuous improvements in typing skills.

This program is beneficial for anyone looking to enhance their typing speed and accuracy, whether for personal or professional purposes.
